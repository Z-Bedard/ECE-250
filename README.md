Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Projects

Overview

This repository contains assignments, projects, and code developed for ECE 250 at the University of Waterloo. This is our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course from the ECE department. The coursework was centered around processing and analyzing data from the World Bank using fundamental and advanced data structures.
The goal was to gain hands-on experience building, using, and optimizing different data structures to efficiently manage and explore large datasets. Both custom implementations and standard library containers were used throughout the course.

Key Concepts and Data Structures
  - Linked Lists
    - Implemented singly and doubly linked lists for dynamic data storage and traversal.

  - Trees
    - Designed and traversed tree structures to represent hierarchical data relationships.

  - Graphs
    - Built and explored graph representations to model relationships between countries based on shared attributes.

  - Standard Library Containers
    - Applied STL structures such as vector, set, map, and unordered_map for efficient storage and retrieval.

  - Hash Tables
    - Created custom hash table implementations and compared them to standard library equivalents.

  - Search and Sort Algorithms
    - Implemented various algorithms to enable efficient querying and organization of World Bank data.


Project Themes
  - Country-Based Data Modeling
    - Each country was represented as a node or object with various attributes (e.g., GDP, population, region).

  - Relationship Analysis
    - Graph edges were formed based on shared features or statistical proximity between countries.

  - Efficient Data Access
    - Focused on choosing the appropriate data structures to optimize performance for different types of queries.


Skills Developed
  - Understanding of time and space complexity trade-offs
  - Building reusable, modular code with a focus on clarity and efficiency
  - Applying real-world datasets to theoretical concepts
  - Working with both low-level custom data structures and high-level abstractions from the standard library
